# Whale Tracking - Smart Money Analysis

## What is Whale Tracking?

Monitoring large wallet movements to identify:

- Early accumulation (smart money buying)
- Distribution (smart money selling)
- Insider activity (dev wallets, team wallets)
- Market manipulation (coordinated pumps/dumps)

## Key Metrics

### Wallet Categories

**🐋 Whales (> $100K positions)**

- Move markets when they buy/sell
- Often insiders or early adopters
- Track their accumulation patterns

**🦈 Sharks ($10K - $100K)**

- Sophisticated retail or small funds
- Good indicator of momentum
- Track their win rate

**🐠 Fish (< $10K)**

- Retail investors
- Often late to moves
- Counter-indicator at extremes

### Important Patterns

**Accumulation:**

- Multiple large buys over hours/days
- Price holds steady despite buying
- Wallet hasn't sold any position
- 🟢 Bullish signal

**Distribution:**

- Multiple large sells
- Selling into pumps
- Position decreasing over time
- 🔴 Bearish signal

**Churn:**

- High buy AND sell volume
- Day trading, not investing
- ⚪️ Neutral - just trading activity

**Insider Selling:**

- Dev wallet selling
- Team wallets cashing out
- Major red flag 🚨

## Wallet Analysis Checklist

When analyzing a whale wallet:

```
□ Check wallet age (new = suspicious)
□ Check win rate (profit on past trades)
□ Check holding time (diamond hands?)
□ Check position size relative to wallet
□ Check if they're still holding
□ Check their buy pattern (accumulation vs FOMO)
□ Cross-reference with other wallets (clusters?)
□ Check if dev-related (team wallet?)
```

## Red Flags in Whale Activity

**🚨 Selling Into Pump:**

- Whale sells right as price moons
- Often means they don't believe in long-term

**🚨 Flash Buying Then Selling:**

- Buy large, sell within hours
- Creating artificial volume
- Likely wash trading or pump & dump

**🚨 Coordinated Wallets:**

- Multiple wallets buying simultaneously
- Same patterns, same timing
- Likely team or insider group

**🚨 Dev Wallet Moving:**

- Team allocation being sold
- Major red flag unless disclosed

## Green Flags

**✅ Consistent Accumulation:**

- Buying dips over days
- Holding through volatility
- Increasing position size

**✅ Smart Money Inflow:**

- More whales buying than selling
- Net positive smart money flow
- Price stable despite accumulation

**✅ Diamond Hands:**

- Large positions held through dumps
- Haven't sold any tokens
- Long-term believers

## Whale Tracking Workflow

```
1. Find token on GMGN.ai or DexScreener
2. Check top 10 holder wallets
3. Analyze each whale:
   - How long held?
   - Win rate on other tokens?
   - Still accumulating?
4. Calculate smart money flow:
   - Total whale buys (24h)
   - Total whale sells (24h)
   - Net inflow/outflow
5. Make decision:
   - Net inflow + accumulation = 🟢 Consider buying
   - Net outflow + distribution = 🔴 Avoid
   - Mixed signals = ⚪️ Wait for clarity
```

## Example Analysis

**Token: $XYZ**

Top Whales:

1. Wallet A: $500K position, held 5 days, hasn't sold
   - Win rate: 80% on last 10 tokens
   - 🟢 Strong accumulation signal

2. Wallet B: $200K position, bought 2 hours ago
   - New wallet, no history
   - ⚪️ Unknown, watch closely

3. Dev Wallet: $1M position, hasn't moved
   - Locked/vested tokens
   - 🟢 No insider selling

**Verdict:** Net smart money inflow + diamond hands = Favorable setup

## Remember

Whales are smart, but they're not always right:

- They can be wrong (even whales lose money)
- They can manipulate (pump their bags, then dump on you)
- They have different timeframes (they might hold through 50% dumps)

**Use whale tracking as ONE data point, not the whole story.**
